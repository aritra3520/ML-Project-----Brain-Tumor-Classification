# ML-Project-----Brain-Tumor-Classification
This Machine Learning Course Project is on Brain Tumor Classification based on its Presence as well as on its Position

# Abstract
In this project, We will do The Brain Tumor Classification from Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images using different machine learning models based on the presence &
positions of it. Since,the conventional method for tumor detection in MRI images is very
time consuming, cost ineffective & inappropriate for large amount of data and MRI images
contain noise due to operator intervention which can lead to inaccurate classiffication, hence
Automated Detection of Tumor in MRI images is necessary as High Accuracy is needed
when dealing with human life. So we will focus on the accuracy using different machine
learning techniques.To get the accuracy as much as high, we shall use different models and
compare the accuracies & consider the best suited model for this purpose.

# Preprocessing :
Refer to [preprocessing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection)

# Model Training:
### 1.Classification on Presence
Here we implemented three types of models:
• Vanilla CNN model from scratch where the data used is :
    – Without Augmentation
    – With Augmentation
• VGG-16
• ResNet50

For Results refer to : [Classification Based on its Presence](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection)

### 2.Classification on Position
• Vanilla CNN model from scratch where the data used is :
Here we implemented three types of models:
    – Without Augmentation
    – With Augmentation
• ResNet
• Efficient-Net
